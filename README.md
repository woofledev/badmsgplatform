# badmsgplatform
a simple room based messaging platform which doesn't steal user data. made in express, sqlite3 and socket.io

probably will add more here soon

## setup
modules are ~30MB so you can host this on a raspberry pi or anything.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/woofledev/badmsgplatform
npm i
npm start
```
you can configure the code yourself, but thats kinda complicated to do. i'll do a config script later on.
