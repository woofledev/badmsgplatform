a simple, small size, room based messaging platform in nodejs, express and socket.io.<br>
readme still in progress!!

## setup
modules are ~30MB so you can host this on a raspberry pi or anything.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/woofledev/badmsgplatform && cd badmsgplatform
npm i
npm start
```
you can configure the code yourself, but thats kinda complicated to do. i'll do a config script later on.
